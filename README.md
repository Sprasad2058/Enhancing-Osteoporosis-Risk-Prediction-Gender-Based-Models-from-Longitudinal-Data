# Enhancing-Osteoporosis-Risk-Prediction-Gender-Based-Models-from-Longitudinal-Data

This project focuses on improving osteoporosis risk prediction through machine learning models trained separately for males and females using longitudinal health data. The study integrates clinical and biochemical factors including age, diabetes status, hormone levels, and bone density indicators to enhance early detection of hip osteoporosis and potential fracture risk.

Key Features:

📊 Gender-specific ML models for better clinical relevance

🧠 Incorporates both static and temporal health features

🔍 Comparison of multiple ML algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.)

📈 Evaluation using metrics like AUC, precision-recall, and F1-score

💾 Dataset preprocessing and longitudinal feature extraction

Objective: To build interpretable, data driven models that improve early identification of individuals at high risk for hip osteoporosis, supporting more personalized prevention strategies.
